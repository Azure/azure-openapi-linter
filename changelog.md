### New validation rules
-	ArraySchemaMustHaveItems â€“ A schema of array type must always contain an items property. without it, AutoRest will fail to generate an SDK. Documentation [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/8ac36944d0ab7f6d07daf077a99bdae873d5e3f6/documentation/openapi-authoring-automated-guidelines.md#R2009) Category: SDK Error
-	LicenseHeaderMustNotBeSpecified - x-ms-code-generation-settings must not have the license section specified in the OpenAPI documents since each generated SDK can have a different licensing header. This information must be provided either from the command line or the configuration file when actually generating the sdk. Documentation [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/8ac36944d0ab7f6d07daf077a99bdae873d5e3f6/documentation/openapi-authoring-automated-guidelines.md#R2065) Category : SDK Warning
-	PostOperationIdContainsUrlVerb - A POST operation's operationId should contain the verb indicated at the end of the corresponding url. Documentation [link](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/blob/8ac36944d0ab7f6d07daf077a99bdae873d5e3f6/documentation/openapi-authoring-automated-guidelines.md#R2066) Category : SDK Warning
