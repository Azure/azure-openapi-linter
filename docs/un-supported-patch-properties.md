- RPC-Patch-V1-02

## Output Message

The patch operation body parameter schema should not contain top level "id", "name", "type", "location" as writable properties. This is because these properties are not patchable. To fix this, either remove the offending properties from the request payload of the Patch operation, or mark them as readOnly or immutable.

## Description

Patch may not change the name, location, or type of the resource.

## How to fix the violation

Consider either removing the top-level properties - "id", "name" and "type", from the patch request body parameter schema, or mark them as readOnly. For the top-level "location" property (that is specified for tracked resources), consider either removing it from the request body of the Patch operation or mark it as immutable using the x-ms-mutability property and values as "create" and "read".
